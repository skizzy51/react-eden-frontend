A fully responsive react shopping application that interacts with a heroku online server

This app has both a default user and an admin page

The user page consists of a home page, cart page, search page and more
To access user specific pages like checkout, update user information, favorites the user would have to be logged in

The admin section gives the admin the power to create products, remove products from inventory, create categories of products, and add products to online store

The admin user already exists in the database so all created users in the app by default would have a role of 'user'
